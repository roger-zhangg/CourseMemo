### **Exercise 1**

Flip 0: 4913
Flip 1: 5087

### Exercise 2

Flip 0: 3936
Flip 1: 6064

### Exercise 3

Pr[Exactly 2 h in 3 flips]=0.432851  theory=0.432

### Exercise 4

- What is the probability that, in 3 flips, the third and only the third flip results in heads?
  - Pr[only 3rd is heads]=0.095991  theory=0.096
- What is the probability that, with an unlimited number of flips, you need at least three flips to see heads for the first time?
  - Pr[need at least 3 flips]=0.159825  theory=0.16
- Why are these two probabilities different?
  - The second condition doesn't require the third flip to be head.

### Exercise 5

Pr[odd+even]=0.249831  theory=0.25

### Exercise 6:

- Pr[c1=club given c2=club]=0.23604529756646053  theory=0.23529411764705882
- Pr[c1=diamond given c2=club]=0.2500602361256124  theory=0.2549019607843137

### Exercise 7:

- heads
- tails

### Exercise 8:

n possible events

### Exercise 9:

- 6 probabilities
- 36 probabilities if we need to roll two dice for there are 36 possible outcomes.

### Exercise 10:

- Axiom 1: Pr[Ω]=1
- Axiom 2: 0≤Pr[A]≤1 for any event A.
- So Pr[A′]=1−Pr[A]

### Exercsie 11:

- Using a couple of numbers, like (1,50), (2,40), The size should be  52*51 = 2652
- The subset shoud be the ({1...13},{1...13}) where the two number are not the same.
- The cardinality is 13*12 = 156
- prob = 156/2652 = 0.058
- The subset should be ({1...13},{1...52}), where two numbers are not the same.
  -  the cardinality = 13*51 = 663
  - The prob = 663/2652 = 0.25

### Exercise 12:

The sample space is unlimited, for the coin flip may never result in head.
