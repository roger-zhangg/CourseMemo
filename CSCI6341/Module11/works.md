### Exercise 1

Yes, google



### Exercise 2

- It's harder because the split-uniform dataset overlaps

- The first guy have more varitey

### Exercise 3

The screen output has 5 point in each class corresponding to the train set

### Exercise 4

- We can use either pixel of the char or vector(start end point of a line segment) of the char
- g.drawLine (x1,y1, x2,y2);
-  The char with more curves will create more line segments. Like B or C.

### Exercise 5

- The size of the image by the color depth.
- No, they are not the same. it depends on the image size.

### Exercise 6

The arm problem

### Exercise 7

- The third input dimension
- The first value of third input dimension
- The label corresponding to the third input dimension

### Exercise 8

- If I create a point with different class near a wrong class point, the classifier will go wrong.
- Distance is meaningless in char problem

### Exercise 9

### Exercise 10



### Exercise 11

### Exercise 12

class0: 0.397

class1: 0.603

### Exercise 13

Pr[X=3|C=0]= 0.091

Pr[X=3|C=1]= 0.609

- because this two number is the value of  prob X3 in C=0. All prob value of X in C=0 add up to 1
- More likely to come from class1

### Exercise 14:
