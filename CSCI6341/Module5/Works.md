- The winch will go up and down using this method
- If we use $V(t) = k_p(y_{Max}+y(t))$ The speed of the elevator will continue to rise and will not stop.

 ### Exercise 3

After Applying the PID, the elevator will stop.

### Exercise 8 

The Unicycle will stuck while it's turning

Adding a filter like `do not turn when dNE >= 40` Will solve the problem for very large dNE noise for turning
