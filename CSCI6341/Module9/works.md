Module 8 21-25 are in module 8 works.

### Exercise 3:

```
Avg x^2: 0.33308660577988347
Avg x: 0.5000630164767703
```

### Exercise 6:

```
Avg x^2: 0.08302358930311014
Avg x: 0.5000630164767703
```

### Exercise 9:

x is in uniform distribution

y is in gussian distribution

### Exercise 10:

```
Pr[Y in [5,7]]: 0.34286
Pr[Y in [5,7] | X in [3,4]]: 0.3409396503994305
```

The distribution of Y doesn't change given the different portion of  X. So these two event should be independent.

### Exercise 24:

```
Mean estimate: 0.5216167255358847
Std-dev estimate: 0.28058637197873465
```



### Exercise 26:

n>1350.5

1351 sample needed

### Exercise 27:

f=0.493

### Exercise 28:

$\delta=\frac{1.96*\sigma^{'}}{\sqrt{n}}$

### Exercise 29:

- Estimate the mean interarrival time.

It's inappropriate that the system time is combined with two independent distributions. As the combined result will not be a normal distribution.
